Python has made programming an absolute pleasure for me. I simply love working with python. The ease of programming and the importance given to programming logic than programming syntax is an absolute delight. I first learnt python from this [tutorial](http://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/). It is an awesome website to learn python. Whenever someone asks me how is it to code in python? I always remember this xkcd comic.
